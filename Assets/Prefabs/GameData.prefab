    RECOMMENDED COURSE OF ACTION: FIND AN ENERGY SOURCE


    (I should try drilling the drone wrecks up ahead.. their batteries still might
    have some charge left in them)'
  - 'Hmm.. I wonder if this place has a wormhole. One of the drones still might have
    left theirs open. I should use my sonar to try to locate it. Should show up as
    a purple dot.


    [PRESS [Z] TO SEND A PING WITH YOUR SONAR]


    I should be careful, pinging costs some energy and it makes a loud noise.'
  - That wormhole will bring my drone back to the mothership. As soon as it starts
    blinking it's ready to take me home.
